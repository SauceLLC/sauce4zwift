Sauce for Zwift™
===========
![Sauce](pages/images/logo_horiz_320x120.png)
#### A collection of add-ons and replacement widgets for Zwift
Sauce for Zwift™ extends the zwift cycling and running simulator with more stats and
pretty things.


Requirements:
--------
As of July 2022 Sauce is a full encrypted game client that "watches" your normal
Zwift account like a 2nd instance of Zwift itself.  As such, you'll need to create
a second login (free is fine).  Although a bit annoying this does allow you to
run S4Z on any device, anywhere.

Feature Highlights
--------
 * Draft %:
   * Don't ask me how it's used in the engine, I don't know, but it's infinitely
     interesting and everyone loves it.
 * Groups view:
   * See the size of your group and others nearby
   * Show the time gap to the groups ahead and behind
   * Accurate gap measurement with virtual checkpoints.  All road positions are
     continually recorded with timestamps for all nearby riders.  The gaps are
     real values from when riders crossed the same point.  Geometric based estimates
     are only used as a fallback when road positions are not yet available (rare).
 * Real stats:
   * Average and Max for power, HR, cadence, speed and event draft
   * Rolling Averages (5s, 5min, etc) for most metrics (power, hr, etc)
   * Peak Averages (5s, 5min, etc) for most metrics (power, hr, etc)
   * NP, TSS, kJ
   * Laps
 * Highly configurable:
   * Dynamic scaling of almost every component to suit all needs
   * Chroma key support for OBS streamers
   * Almost every field can be changed
   * Pick and choose which windows you want visible and configure each of them with unique custom settings
 * Gauges:
   * Power (with zones), Draft, Speed, HR
 * Improved chat client:
   * Avatar
   * Gap to athlete
   * Real time power, hr of athlete
   * Support to mute people
 * Nearby riders/runners table with extensive field options.
 * Web server access to all the widgets.
   * Port 1080 by default (configurable) e.g. http://localhost:1080
   * REST / WebSocket API for programmers
